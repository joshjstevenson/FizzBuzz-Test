/* 
Using JavaScript write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
*/

/*
Observed reasons that make this a good test:

1. It can be achieved by multiple solutions. I chose to create a function, named fizzbuzz, 
using arrow function expression, a for loop and if else statement.

2. It tests your understanding of loops, nesting, conditional statements, operators, 
functions and logic; if written incorrectly, Fizz may override FizzBuzz if the condition for 
Fizz is met first, resulting in no FizzBuzz outputs. FizzBuzz could also be defined with, 
(i % 15 === 0), to remove some code.

3. It also tests your general understanding of computer language and attention to detail. 
The questions asks for you to print from 1-100, meaning you have to specify in your loop 1-101;
as 0-100 will include 0 and skip 100.
